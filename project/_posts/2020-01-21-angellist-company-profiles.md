I led design to rebuild Company Profiles from the ground up. As a result, we tripled user acquisition and conversion, and significantly improved site performance.

## The Challenge
As a core piece of our talent marketplace, Company Profiles should represent employers as a great place to work and compel job seekers to apply. However, because it was originally created to capture fundraising attention, the profiles were misaligned with recruiters and candidates alike and fell behind our competitors.

Our priority was to ship a product that met table stakes requirements. Any nice-to-haves would have to come later.

## Process
I was the lead designer with contributions from my Head of Design and worked closely with three other engineers. I led user research, design, and eventually product management. The project lasted 9 months and was fully shipped in Aug 2019.

## Focus Existing Data
### Information architecture
There were in actuality two employer profiles: Company Profiles and Job Showcase. Each had a separate entry point and were not consistent across the data points they shared. Profiles had become the org chart: one made for venture and one patched on for job-seeking.

### Trim fatty features
Evaluating the utility of each existing feature in user research, we ruthlessly cut nearly half from the new profile. Those that didn't make it proved to either be irrelevant to job seekers or inherently valuable but not enough to justify cost to rebuild. For the latter, we shelved and set to revisit later down the roadmap.

### Finesse the rest
Stuff

## Introduce New Data
As a valuable resource to candidates, we need to at least bring ourselves up to the playing field by providing a baseline set of data. The biggest gap in this being culture data.

## Engage data completion
### Mirrored editing

### Simplified user permissions

## Conclusion


The redesign also sparked the first contributions to our design system, Halo. The components taken from Company Profiles have since shipped to numerous other projects.
