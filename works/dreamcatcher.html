While trying to think up of some great ideas, we realized that the greatest source of ideas are other people. People will always dream of the next big thing, and creators will always have the passion to create. DreamCatcher aims to merge these two powerful forces. We provide a platform that gives every dreamer the opportunity to voice their ideas in a constructive and collaborative environment. In addition, every avid creators can browse through innovative ideas, pledge to implement them, and use our website to post updates about their progress. We are empowering thinkers, feeding builders, and accelerating innovation."
