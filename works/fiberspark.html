		"Here at Fiberspark we noticed two problems with the internet service offered by other companies: it took too long to do the things we love, and hassle free help was hard to come by. We looked into the technology and found that fiber optics house an underutilized potential to revolutionize internet service and provide all the content you love at significantly faster speeds."

	<p>Fiberspark is a fiber optics internet provider founded by two Cornell University students, Jeff Shaffer and Jay Lee. Having shared the same office for several months as a result of my work with Life Changing Labs, I was approached to help them produce a more attractive logo for their customers.</p>
	<br>
	<div class="header">the process</div>
	<p>The original logo is shown below. It is outdated and irrelevant of Fiberspark's services or character.</p>
	<img class="uk-width-2-3 uk-width-medium-1-3 uk-width-large-1-5 uk-container-center" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/fiberspark/original.png">
	<p>The first draft saw a change of font and color schemes but kept a familiarity to the original logo.</p>

	<p>Then I decided to move away from familiarity because the feeling it gave was corporate and constricting. This was undesirable to our target audience and does not offer the highly innovative and whimsical attitude that Jeff and Jay bring into their work. I changed the font to embrace a more modern look and played with a hummingbird to convey speed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I finalized the hummingbird into something more "high speed internet" and less "boutique" by playing with its form and lines, representing the networks of fiber optics.</p>
