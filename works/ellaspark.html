		<p>Ellaspark was an idea ignited from watching the rapidly rising interest in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" alt="KickStarter" target="_blank">KickStarter</a>, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" alt="Indiegogo" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a>, <a href="https://www.tilt.com/" alt="Tilt" target="_blank">Tilt (formerly Crowdtilt)</a>, <a href="http://www.fundable.com/" alt="Fundable" target="_blank">Fundable</a>, etc. As a wild experiment but also a serious investment, we created a platform that played on the concept of crowndfunding (which we lovingly coined as "reverse crowdfunding"). In a nutshell, the strategy was that for users to fund a project, they chipped in to the total reward. This acted like an ante in a game of poker, where those with the most votes won the money raised by the users themselves.<br><br></p>
		<p>And initially, we had seven categories (art, charity, film, food, music, technology, and others) with each holding its own competition, varying in cause and reward amount. After four months, we decided to narrow down to only the music category for the sake of confirming our business model before delving into seven. During this time, we applied for and was accepted into the <a href="http://www.elabstartup.com/" target="_blank">eLab Accelerator Program</a>. We also went down to New York City during the auditions for America's Got Talent to gain insight into our target audience.<br><br></p>

		<p>Unfortunately, while the trip began extremely optimistically, we ultimately came home with the realization that our platform didn't particularly fit with our target users. Of the dozens of musicans we interviewed for two days, they all explicitly stated that rather than money, the only thing they wanted was exposure to potential listeners. And while Ellaspark could, in a sense, provide that if we gained a large user base, our primary service would be essentially obsolete.<br><br></p>
		<p>After deep considerations, we tried one more time to pivot our model, this time instead toward startups, which we knew could definitely benefit from funding. At the same time, we sought to increase the initial "ante" to around $100 so that the reward would more realistically aid the business and also rely less on a large number of participants for enough payout. At almost one year after Ellaspark began, this approach also died. Young businesses were too skeptical to invest the money and more mature ones didn't require the meager amount we were offering. And although several local startups expressed interest in our platform, they too preferred more experienced and reputable VC firms in the end.<br><br></p>
		<p>But in conclusion, no experience is utterly useless, because the lessons that we learned were just as valuable if we were successful. These are things that we will continue to take with us as we continue to larger journeys and at the very least, we had tons of fun. Below, I've included any remainder assets we've kept for those who are curious as to the evidence left behind.</p>
