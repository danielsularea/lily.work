		<p>The Cornell Business Review is a magazine organization that strives to encourage the education and discussion of business trends and issues among the Cornell student body by publishing a business review and hosting related events. However, as a very young organization, it had not yet found its identity when I joined as a freshman. After spending a semester overhualing the brand and the magazine, the then editor-in-chief (now graduated) decided to allow me to recruit a team of designers to work with me. Initially a small group of two students, my team has now grown to five designers along with a few freelance illustrators for special requests.</p>

		<div class="header uk-width-1-1 uk-text-left">the brand</div>
		<p>As a publication to invoke conversations on business ideas and concerns, the Cornell Business Review needed to reflect professionalism and trusted reputability. The logo must be suitable for both online and print usage. It must also be timeless because a magazine is a physical item that will last years on the bookshelf.</p>

			For the magazine, I've completely redesigned the layout in order to be consistent with the brand that the Cornell Business Review is now defined by. It is effortlessly clean and professionally presented, making it easy to immediately digest but still result in a high visual impact.

		<p>In the two years of CBR's complete rebranding and redesign efforts, we've seen not only a larger pool of design applicants each year but also an increased level of proficiency in our applicants. This means that we are attracting more interest from higher skilled designers, particularly those in Cornell's <a href="http://aap.cornell.edu" target="_blank">College of Architecture, Art, and Planning</a>.</p>
		<p>At the same time, we have become more reputable as a magazine, receiving praise from the president of Cornell University David Skorton; deans of <a href="http://www.ilr.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Industrial and Labor Relations</a>, <a href="http://cals.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Agriculture and Life Sciences</a>, and <a href="https://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Hotel Administration</a>; head of <a href="http://dyson.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Applied Economics and Management</a>; board members; and various professors. One professor even tweeted our latest issue:</p>

		<p>In order to keep up with our growth, we underwent a project towards a weekly newsletter for readers that demanded more frequent content than our semesterly publication. However, this met with difficulties in meeting the same standards that we hold our magazine and we are now moving the newsletter to an online website. This will not only make it easier to provide consistent material but also establish an online presence that we've lacked in the past. Currently, this is still an ongoing project and results will be updated soon.</p>
