There is huge controversy around anything that is free or crowdsourced, and Wikipedia is both. But as an homage to the greatest group project member since 2001 (I was in first grade. I've literally never had schooling without it!), I've decided to make the <a href="{{ site.url }}/works/wikireader.html" target="_blank">WikiReader</a>.
<br><br>
Oh, but there's also <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/" target="_blank">Wikiwand</a>. It's award-winning, has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wikiwand" target="_blank">$600,000 in funding</a>, and is rated #3 worldwide on the Chrome Web Store. Why the hell would I mess with that?

<div class="header">here's why</div>
Released in August of 2014, I had Wikiwand installed long before I thought about making a Chrome extension of my own. I had it for a good few months too, the second week of which I totally forgot what the old interface even looked like. But after the initial excitement went away, I found myself being bothered by how heavy the extension felt, how it was more eager to have the spotlight for itself than support the body of information from backstage. Essentially, it was distracting me from what I came here for.
