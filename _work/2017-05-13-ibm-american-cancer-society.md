In April 2016, IBM and the American Cancer Society announced a partnership to create the first advisor for those fighting cancer, powered by Watson cognitive computing.

## Background

Founded in 1913, the American Cancer Society (ACS) sought to raise public awareness on a subject that was, at the time, responded to with fear and silence. Since then, cancer deaths have <a href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html" target="_blank">dropped 25%</a> in the United States and open conversations have become vital to a higher quality of life during cancer experiences.

However, even with advances in modern medicine and supportive care, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180371" target="_blank">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923796" target="_blank">studies</a> still show concern that lay understanding of cancer is suboptimal. *Patients and their caregivers lack the medical framework to fully comprehend and manage their cancer.*

In order to empower conversations around cancer, ACS and IBM saw an opportunity to combine powerful resources from both sides: ACS's massive database of cancer knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligent features, widely personified as "Watson". *The mission was to build a consumer-facing mobile app that empowers patients and caregivers in having fuller and more educated conversations about their cancer.*

## My Role

This was an ambitious project spearheaded by an early product development team within IBM. *I was the product designer and worked with a project lead and two user researchers.*
