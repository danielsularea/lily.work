In April 2016, IBM and the American Cancer Society announced a partnership to create a Watson mobile app for those fighting cancer.

## Background

Founded in 1913, the American Cancer Society (ACS) sought to raise public awareness on a subject that was, at the time, responded to with fear and silence. Since then, cancer deaths have <a href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html" target="_blank">dropped 25%</a> in the United States and open conversations have become vital to a higher quality of life during cancer experiences.

However, even with advances in modern medicine and supportive care, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180371" target="_blank">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923796" target="_blank">studies</a> still show concern that lay understanding of cancer is suboptimal. *Patients and their caregivers lack the medical framework to fully comprehend and manage their cancer.*

In order to empower conversations around cancer, ACS and IBM saw an opportunity to combine powerful resources from both sides: ACS's massive database of cancer knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligent features, widely personified as "Watson". *The mission was to build a consumer-facing mobile app that empowers patients and caregivers to be more educated about their cancer.*

## My Role

This was an ambitious project spearheaded by an early product development team within IBM. *I joined as the product designer in October 2016 and worked with a project lead and three user researchers.*

Together, we were responsible for biweekly updates to both ACS and IBM stakeholders as well as the final hand off to the production team in February 2017.

## Early Insights

To begin, we leveraged our partnership with ACS to speak to specialists at various facilities, including a call center in Austin and <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/support-programs-and-services/patient-lodging/hope-lodge.html" target="_blank">Hope Lodges</a> in Boston and New York.

*Our objective was to understand the information-seeking patterns of cancer patients when they reached out to these resources.*

In summary, patients often engaged with ACS specialists to:

### Recognize credible and updated sources
As information online continues to be more comprehensive and accessible, patients struggled to recognize credible and truthful sources. This was especially difficult as the medical domain around cancer is constantly updating.

### Find relevancy in a sea of information
Patients rarely dialed in to the call center because they couldn't find information. Instead, they struggled to distinguish of all the information that they were given and had available, what was actually relevant to their diagnosis and progress?

### Build meaningful conversation with doctors
When patients looked up information outside of a doctor's appointment, their goals typically were to prepare more educated questions for the next consult, become more confident about their doctor's decisions, and follow up on any confusing concepts.

## The Cancer Journey

Nearly 40% of men and women in the US will be diagnosed with cancer within their lifetime. Each patient stands to undergo the most emotionally and physically significant experience they will ever have.

To understand this experience, we interviewed 12 patients, 18 caregivers, and 43 healthcare professionals ranging between oncologists, nurses, and medical assistants.

After gaining a more sophisticated understanding of the cancer journey, we noticed a few key insights:

### Patients' caregivers were typically their family members

Of all the patients we spoke to, very few were able to afford a licensed caregiver. Instead, *most caregivers were the patient's spouse or children*, who would take up additional housework and accompany them to the doctor's.

And because these family members often didn't have a medical background themselves, they often coped with their sense of helplessness by becoming the primary person researching and compiling cancer information in order to support the patient.

### Doctors remained the preferred source of information

Despite an increasing variety and volume of cancer resources through the internet, *patients still preferred to seek answers from their doctors because they were able to provide the most relevant and credible answers.*

And even when patients expressed concern about their doctor's judgement and wanted a second opinion, they consulted with other doctors from a different facility.

### Patients wanted to revisit their conversations with their doctor

Caregivers often accompanied patients to their oncology appointments in order to be an extra pair of ears and take copious notes. However, since caregivers were typically unlicensed, they struggled to properly capture the medical jargon or concepts that doctors may bring up.

As a result, doctors said that *many patients recorded their consultation sessions even when their caregivers came in with them.* They would then take the tape home, rewind to understand the content, and come back with more questions.
