In April 2016, IBM and the American Cancer Society announced a partnership to create the first advisor for those fighting cancer, powered by Watson cognitive computing.

## Background

Founded in 1913, the American Cancer Society (ACS) sought to raise public awareness on a subject that was, at the time, responded to with fear and silence. Since then, cancer deaths have <a href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html" target="_blank">dropped 25%</a> in the United States and open conversations have become vital to a higher quality of life during cancer experiences.

However, even with advances in modern medicine and supportive care, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180371" target="_blank">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923796" target="_blank">studies</a> still show concern that lay understanding of cancer is suboptimal. *Patients and their caregivers lack the medical framework to fully comprehend and manage their cancer.*

In order to empower conversations around cancer, ACS and IBM saw an opportunity to combine powerful resources from both sides: ACS's massive database of cancer knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligent features, widely personified as "Watson". *The mission was to build a consumer-facing mobile app that empowers patients and caregivers to be more educated about their cancer.*

## My Role

This was an ambitious project spearheaded by an early product development team within IBM. *I joined as the product designer in October 2016 and worked with a project lead and two user researchers.*

Together, we were responsible for biweekly updates to both ACS and IBM stakeholders as well as the final hand off to the production team in February 2017.

## Early Insights

To begin, we leveraged our partnership to speak to specialists at ACS facilities, including a call center in Austin and <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/support-programs-and-services/patient-lodging/hope-lodge.html" target="_blank">Hope Lodges</a> in Boston and New York.

*Our objective was to understand the information-seeking patterns and needs of patients and caregivers when they reach out to these facilities.* This is what we learned:

### 1. Recognize credible and updated sources
As information online continues to be more comprehensive and accessible, *patients and caregivers struggled to recognize credible and truthful sources.* This is especially difficult as the medical domain around cancer is constantly updating.

### 2. Find relevancy in a sea of information
Patients and caregivers often dialed in to the ACS call center to ask: *of all the information that they were given and had available, what was actually relevant to their diagnosis and progress?* And with no way to track repeat callers, ACS employees found that they had to ask basic information about the patient each and every call.

### 3. Build meaningful conversation with doctors
When patients looked up information outside of a doctor's appointment, *their goals typically were to prepare more educated questions for the next consult, become more confident about their doctor's decisions, and follow up on confusing concepts.*

## The Cancer Journey

Nearly 40% of men and women in the US will be diagnosed with cancer within their lifetime. Each patient and their caregiver stands to undergo the most emotionally and physically significant experience they will ever have.

To understand this experience, we interviewed 30 patients and caregivers, as well as 43 healthcare professionals ranging between oncologists, nurses, and medical assistants.

Now that we've gained a more sophisticated understanding of the cancer journey, we created the following guiding principles going forward:
1. Help navigate information noise, not add to it
2. Strengthen human relationships
3. XXX???

## Proposed Solutions

After 4 months of user research and extensive help from Watson cognitive services development, *our team proposed a suite of AI features that would compliment each other but could also thrive as standalone.* Each one was validated through weeks of usability testing and would come down to business need and feasibility evaluations.

### Knowledge Collaboration

We observed that patients and caregivers didn't really struggle with a lack of information. Instead, they were usually so overwhelmed with information that they would have to consolidate all their research into a "cancer binder", which they would take with them to doctor's appointments.

This binder served as the source of truth, but it was also clunky, non-replicable, and difficult to index.

### Consult Transcription

Caregivers often accompanied patients to their oncology appointments in order to be an extra pair of ears and take copious notes. However, caregivers still struggled to properly capture the medical jargon or concepts that doctors may bring up.

To improve this experience, we
