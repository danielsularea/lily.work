In April 2016, IBM and the American Cancer Society announced a partnership to create the first advisor for those fighting cancer, powered by Watson cognitive computing.

Due to the confidential nature of the project and the individuals involved, secondary research may be used to broadly represent certain insights gathered from primary research. Any other sensitive information may also be obfuscated or omitted.

## Background

Founded in 1913, the American Cancer Society (ACS) sought to raise public awareness on a subject that was, at the time, responded to with fear and silence. Since then, cancer deaths have <a href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html" target="_blank">dropped 25%</a> in the United States and open conversations have become vital to a higher quality of life during cancer experiences.

However, even with advances in modern medicine and supportive care, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180371" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923796" target="_blank">studies</a> still show concern that lay understanding of cancer is suboptimal. *Patients and their caregivers lack the medical framework to fully comprehend and manage their cancer.*

</blockquote>

In order to empower conversations around cancer, ACS and IBM saw an opportunity to combine powerful resources from both sides: ACS's massive database of cancer knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligent features, widely personified as "Watson". *The mission was to build a consumer-facing mobile app that empowers patients and caregivers in having fuller and more educated conversations about their cancer.*

Our guiding principles were to:
1. Navigate information noise, not add to it
2. Strengthen human relationships
3. Optimize both ACS and IBM resources

## Team

Within IBM, this was an ambitious project spearheaded by an early product development team of just four members. *I was the product designer and owe my thanks to the project lead and two extraordinary user researchers.*

Together, we were responsible for biweekly updates to both ACS and IBM stakeholders and ultimately hand off to a production team, which finished in February 2017.

## Early Insights

Due to the sensitive nature of our investigation, the team needed to garner a sophisticated understanding of the cancer journey before approaching patients and their caregivers. *To begin, we leveraged our parternship to speak to specialists at ACS facilities, including a call center in Austin and <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/support-programs-and-services/patient-lodging/hope-lodge.html" target="_blank">Hope Lodges</a> in Boston and New York.* This is what we learned:

1. **Health Literacy**<br>
ACS employees often found themselves consolidating and translating medical information for patients. Particularly important was pointing out what is most relevant to each individual's diagnosis and progress.

2. **Online Research**<br>
As information online continues to be more comprehensive and accessible, patients and caregives struggle to recognize credible and truthful sources. This is especially difficult as the medical domain around cancer is constantly updating.

3. **Clinical Encounter Support**<br>
Patients sought information in order to build a more meaningful conversation with their doctor. Their goals typically were to ask more educated questions, be more confident about their doctor's decisions, and follow up on confusing concepts in the aftermath of a consultation.

<!-- Regardless of type of information, patients and caregivers still struggle with credibility of the source, relevancy to their diagnosis, conflicting cross-references, and their own limited health literacy.

Most people (77%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that they would have more confidence in online health information if it was endorsed by a recognised professional body. - Online information as a decision making aid for cancer patients: Recommendations from the Eurocancercoms project -->

## Personas

Nearly 40% of men and women in the US will be diagnosed with cancer within their lifetime. Each patient stands to undergo the most emotionally and physically significant experience they will ever have.

  <p>If we undertake to study human lives, we have to be ready to face human feelings.</p>

</blockquote>

In order to fully comprehend the cancer journey, our personas will serve two purposes:

1. Validate and expand our assumptions surrounding 
2. Formulate our understanding of the cancer experience so that our solution integrates seamlessly into existing scenarios.

## Hypotheses

We identify the problem statement to be difficulty navigating cancer information, not lack thereof. Therefore, we are not developing another source of information.
