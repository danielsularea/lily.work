  <div class="article__body">
    <p>I'm Lily, a <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> senior finishing my computer science major in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=weather+in+ithaca,+ny&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">chilly Ithaca, NY</a>. I was born in China with my artist grandfather and raised in America by my programmer father. As a result, I have a great appreciation for art and technology and everything in between. During my years at Cornell, I spent more time with <a href="http://www.lifechanginglabs.com" target="_blank">startups</a> (about a dozen or so) than in class, wherein the former sometimes schooled me pretty hard  anyways. After graduation, I will be moving on to be a software designer for <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/" target="_blank">IBM</a> at the Cambridge office, where I hope to get paid to do more cool stuff.</p>

    <p>I believe in minimaism and I love experiments. Right now, I'm going through a phase of applying physical design to digital design, particularly print and packaging. I also like to do new things for the heck of it, no matter how obviously useless or ironically useful it is. Recent "for-kicks" achievements include: snowboarding, boxing, <a href="http://medium.com/@_lilllli" target="_blank">Arduino</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/_lilllli/status/723978939857776641" target="_blank">ink art</a>. My biggest fear is running out of time to do all the side projects I keep piling up on my notepad.</p>

    Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog">blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/_lilllli" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to see anything else I'm up to. While I'm not currently exploring new opportunities, I would love to talk about your next big idea so <a href="mailto:qc53@cornell.edu">give me a shout.</a></p>

    <p>P.S. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc" target="_blank">TED talk</a> changed my life.</p>
