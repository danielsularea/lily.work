<div id="title">Humble Beginnings</div>
Very little these days can render someone firmly humble of what they have. One catalyst of such feelings could be a near death experience, in which a person confronts the possibility of their own death and thereby loss of life and livelihood. Another version that is less dramatic and terminal could be bankruptcy, wherein the proof that money can buy happiness lies. For me, I experienced the least drama-ridden option and returned to my childhood roots.

Everything in China is smaller than I recall. Of course, I had left when I was barely eight and only visited once more when I was fourteen. But the alleyways have gotten impossibly narrow and the apartment I grew up in seemed to have slowly collapsed on itself. The weather is unreasonably warm and humid, so much so that the clothes weâ€™ve hung to dry two days ago are still soaked. My skin has become almost unsettlingly soft from the constant moisture, like the tender flesh of freshly cooked fish as it slides off the bones. Everything is wet with the regularly resupplied rainwater and unmentionables oozing out of garbage bags left everywhere in the streets and polluted streams.

High inflation has split the residents here into the extreme poor and the upmost wealthy, those of the former cramped into decaying apartment buildings and the latter enjoying guarded complexes with an artificial lakeside view. The concept of space and hygiene are almost materialistic goods as they can only be afforded by the wildly rich. Although my family is considered fairly well off in our financial status, our apartment resides within one of the decrepit apartment buildings occupied by the poor. The exterior has browned, rusted, and chipped off, despite only being built twenty years ago. (My parents had bought the then newly constructed apartment a year before I was born.) Nothing here seems to have been made to last as I find out every building showing signs of decay are at most fifty years old. As a result, the wealthy constantly leave their decades old apartments for the poor to now occupy and move into completely new complexes built on the demolished grounds previously resided by the very same impoverished people.

Ironically, although nothing lasts and the people constantly abandon one home for another, the truth is that nothing at all seems to change in the grand scheme of things. The buildings and people simply exchange locations every few decades, neither actually ever improving their quality of life. The stagnancy in the truth is actually suffocating because in the end, the buildings will still never last more than a few decades and the people shuffled into their respective classes will never leave. Only Mother Nature acknowledges the stagnancy as her hot, polluted, and wet air hangs in the face of the people here and weighs on their shoulders, in a way reminding them of the truth in the most subtle but constant way possible.
