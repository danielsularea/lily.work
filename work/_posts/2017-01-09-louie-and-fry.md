Louie and Fry were personal experiments with Jekyll ruby-based themes and unconventional web design.

As of July 2016, Jekyll [v3.2.0][version]{:target="_blank"} released support of versionable, first-class themes that were bundled as RubyGems. The process has been made incredibly intuitive for theme creators so I took a crack at some over an afternoon.

Disclaimer that because this was a creative exercise, I left behind considerations for responsiveness, accessibility, performance, and edge case usages. Certainly don't take these past face value. I had tons of fun and learned a bunch about Jekyll and packaging gems.

Despite that though, I did have some users install my gem theme anyways and send me great feedback. They were much appreciated.
