As of July 2016, Jekyll [v3.2.0][version]{:target="_blank"} released support of versionable, first-class themes that were bundled as RubyGems. The process has been made incredibly intuitive for theme creators so I took a crack at some over an afternoon.

Building a theme is as straightforward as creating any Jekyll site.
