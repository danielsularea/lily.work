I led design to rebuild AngelList's Company Profiles from the ground up. As a result, we tripled user acquisition and conversion, and significantly improved site performance.

## The Challenge
As a core piece of our talent marketplace, *Company Profiles should represent employers as a great place to work and compel job seekers to apply.* But, originally created to capture fundraising attention, the profiles became misaligned with recruiters and candidates alike and fell behind our competitors.

<!-- Our priority was to first ship a product that met table stakes requirements. Any nice-to-haves would have to come later. -->

## Process
I was the lead designer with contributions from my Head of Design and worked closely with three engineers. I led user research, design, and eventually product management. The project lasted 9 months and was fully shipped in August 2019.

## Existing Problems
### Fragmented information architecture
There were in actuality two employer profiles: Company Profiles and Job Showcase. Each had a separate entry point and were not consistent across the data points they shared. Profiles had become the org chart: one made for venture and one patched on for job-seeking.

### Irrelevant information for job seekers
When researching a company, job seekers found the information on Company Profiles to be irrelevant or insufficient. A mixture of unmaintained features (Launches, Press, Followers) and fundraising-specific features (Board Members, Advisors) crowded the interface.

### Poor profile setup experience
During profile set up, recruiters dropped off and abandoned their profile due to poor user experience. They didn't feel like they could successfully represent their brand and there were no engagement loops on our end to promote profile upkeep.

## New Company Profiles

*Now all under one roof, Company Profiles focuses on what job seekers care about.* From user research, we ruthlessly cut half of the features from the old profiles (with some on the roadmap to be brought back, properly this time).

### Putting the team upfront
The new people cards put a spotlight on the teams behind the company, including a snapshot of the founders' background.

### Introducing company culture
As a valuable resource to job seekers, we had to provide a certain baseline set of data&mdash;the biggest gap in this being company culture. Now companies can showcase office life as well as perks and benefits.

### Flexible applications
We also updated the job application to accommodate companies that want to add custom questions or double check visa and location requirements. This modal will ship across the entire platform, even outside the new profiles.

## Conclusion

The redesign also sparked the first contributions to our design system, Halo. The components taken from Company Profiles have since shipped to numerous other projects.
