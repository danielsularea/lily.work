## The challenge
The Cornell Business Review is a magazine organization that strives to encourage the education and discussion of business trends and issues among the Cornell student body by publishing a business review and hosting related events. However, as a very young organization, it had not yet found its identity when I joined as a freshman. Initially a small group of two students, my team eventually grew to five designers along with a few freelance illustrators for special requests.

## The brand
As a publication to invoke conversations on business ideas and concerns, the Cornell Business Review needed to reflect professionalism and trusted reputability. The logo must be suitable for both online and print usage. It also had to be timeless because a magazine is a physical item that will last years on the bookshelf.

## The magazine
For the magazine, I completely redesigned the layout in order to be consistent with the brand that the Cornell Business Review is now defined by. It is effortlessly clean and professionally presented, making it easy to immediately digest but still result in a high visual impact.

## Outcome
In the two years of CBR's complete rebranding and redesign efforts, we've seen not only a larger pool of design applicants each year but also an increased level of proficiency in our applicants. This means that we are attracting more interest from higher skilled designers, particularly those in Cornell's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning.

At the same time, we have become more reputable as a magazine, receiving praise from the president of Cornell University David Skorton; deans of Industrial and Labor Relations, Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Hotel Administration; head of Applied Economics and Management; board members; and various professors.
