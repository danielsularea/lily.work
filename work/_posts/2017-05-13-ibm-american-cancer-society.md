In April 2016, IBM and the American Cancer Society announced a partnership to create the first advisor for those fighting cancer, powered by Watson cognitive computing.

Due to the confidential nature of the project and the individuals involved, secondary research may be used to broadly represent certain insights gathered from primary research. Any other sensitive information may also be obfuscated or omitted.

## Background

Founded in 1913, the American Cancer Society (ACS) sought to raise public awareness on a subject that was, at the time, responded to with fear and silence. Since then, cancer deaths have [dropped 25%](https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html){:target="_blank"} in the United States and open conversations have become vital to a higher quality of life during cancer experiences.

However, despite these advances in modern medicine and supportive care, [many](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180371){:target="_blank"} [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923796){:target="_blank"} still show concern that lay understanding of cancer is suboptimal. *Patients and their caregivers lack the medical framework to fully comprehend and manage their cancer.*

In order to empower conversations around cancer, ACS and IBM saw an opportunity to draw powerful resources from both sides: ACS's massive database of cancer knowledge and de-identified call center records and IBM's artificial intelligent features, widely personified as "Watson". *The mission is to build an consumer-facing mobile app that empowers patients and caregivers in having fuller and more educated conversations about their cancer.*

## The Team

Within IBM, this was an ambitious project spearheaded by an early product development team of just four members. *I was the product designer and owe my work to the project lead and two extraordinary user researchers.*

Together, we were responsible for biweekly updates to both ACS and IBM stakeholders and hand off to a production team, which  February 2017.

## Generative Research

Despite the expanding variety of resources for cancer patients and caregivers, the predominant source of information remains to be healthcare professionals. However,

Regardless of type of information, patients and caregivers still struggle with credibility of the source, relevancy to their diagnosis, conflicting cross-references, and their own limited health literacy.

Notable in this list, however, is that "lack of information" is not included.

Most people (77%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that they would have more confidence in online health information if it was endorsed by a recognised professional body. - Online information as a decision making aid for cancer patients: Recommendations from the Eurocancercoms project

## Personas

Nearly 40% of men and women in the US will be diagnosed with cancer within their lifetime. Each patient stands to undergo the most emotionally and physically significant experience they will ever have.

In order to fully comprehend the cancer journey, our personas will serve two purposes:

1. Validate and expand our assumptions surrounding 
2. Formulate our understanding of the cancer experience so that our solution integrates seamlessly into existing scenarios.

<!-- ## Guiding Principles

1. Surface relevant information<br/>
Help users navigate information by surfacing them as they become relevant.

2. Strengthen relationships<br/>
We choose to focus on direct, in-person interaction. In our research, we have found that the main motive for  -->

## Hypotheses

We identify the problem statement to be difficulty navigating cancer information, not lack thereof. Therefore, we are not developing another source of information.
