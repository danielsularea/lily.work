IBM partners with the American Cancer Society to develop a consumer-facing app to

## Background

Founded in 1913, the American Cancer Society (ACS) sought to raise public awareness on a subject that was, at the time, responded with fear and silence. Today, cancer deaths have [dropped 25%](https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html){:target="_blank"} in the United States and open conversations have become vital to a higher quality of life during cancer experiences.

However, despite these advances in modern medicine and supportive care, studies show that lay understanding of cancer is still suboptimal 


cancer patients still lack the medical framework to fully comprehend and manage their cancer.

This problem can be loosely divided into two 

By leveraging ACS's extensive database and IBM Watson's artifical intelligent features, my team and I design a 

## Problem Statement

Despite the expanding variety of resources for cancer patients and caregivers, the predominant source of information remains to be healthcare professionals. However, 

Regardless of type of information, patients and caregivers still struggle with credibility of the source, relevancy to their diagnosis, conflicting cross-references, and their own limited health literacy.

Notable in this list, however, is that "lack of information" is not included.

## Personas

Nearly 40% of men and women in the US will be diagnosed with cancer within their lifetime. Each patient stands to undergo the most emotionally and physically significant experience they will ever have.

In order to fully comprehend the cancer journey, our personas will serve two purposes:

1. Validate and expand our assumptions surrounding 
2. Formulate our understanding of the cancer experience so that our solution integrates seamlessly into existing scenarios.

## Guiding Principles

1. Surface relevant information<br/>
Users are already innundated with resources and options.  Instead, we seek to collect and organize sources and surface them as they become relevant.

2. Strengthen relationships<br/>
We choose to focus on direct, in-person interaction. In our research, we have found that the main motive for 

## Hypotheses

We identify the problem statement to be difficulty navigating cancer information, not lack thereof. Therefore, we are not developing another source of information.
