			"Here at Fiberspark we noticed two problems with the internet service offered by other companies: it took too long to do the things we love, and hassle free help was hard to come by. We looked into the technology and found that fiber optics house an underutilized potential to revolutionize internet service and provide all the content you love at significantly faster speeds."<br><br>

			<div id="header" class="smallcaps">New Logo</div>

			Then I decided to move away from familiarity because the feeling it gave was corporate and constricting. This was undesirable to our target audience and does not offer the highly innovative and whimsical ambience that Fiberspark actually embodies.<br><br>
			I changed the font to embrace a more modern look and played with a hummingbird to convey speed.<br>

			Finally, I finalized the hummingbird into something more "high speed internet" and less "boutique" by playing with its form and lines.<br>
