And here it is. Voil&#224;. Over three months of labor with admittedly rather wide leave of absences in between (for good reasons, I swear) comes the third reincarnation of this portfolio. I shut down v2.0 with a construction sign in late May, 2014, promising something "awesome" with the big reveal of the next iteration. Now here is the deliverable and I'm not 100% confident that some mild disappointment isn't being stirred. Because my something awesome isn't quite out there. It's not embellished. It's not obvious. It's the whole thing. I like the whole thing. It's awesome because I like it. The short lifespans of v1.0 and v2.0 proved just how my disastified squinting at my previous portfolios quickly led to the uncomfortable retouching and ultimate demise of the old designs. But this one. This one is a keeper. I think.

<div class="header">purpose of this blog</div>
Now a blog is a new feature to my portfolio&#8212;to this version and to all its predecessors. I used to have a section in v2.0 dedicated to showcase my creative writing, sprinkled with a few memoirs and an experimental parody of Virginia Woolf's <i>A Room of One's Own</i> I'd written in high school. Now while I still continue to dabble in prose in my free time, I figured while I'm in the midst of a makeover, I'd point my portfolio towards the audience it's intended for&#8212;one who is interested in my work as a CS student and my thoughts surrounding such. Of course, I might ramble here and there (in fact, I am entertaining thoughts on a post about office pets...) but I am determined to stay en route to what we're all here for.

A few final pixels of v2.0. As you can tell, my signature remains to be the digital representation of myself and my dance with minimalism is nothing new. What has since been improved upon, I hope, is the structure and intuition of the website.

<div class="header">unfinished business</div>
A to-do list:<br>
- More comprehensive case studies of each past work<br>
- Possibly add a footer. Right now, pages are ending rather abruptly in a confusion of whitespace<br>
- Replace hover over effect on landing page in mobile devices with something more intuitive to the device<br>
- The FBI-confidential-crossout effect for the links in the navbar isn't quite centered on some computers and devices
- The back button on the bottom of work pages need to be cleaner and more obvious.
