Voil&#224;. Over three months of labor with admittedly rather wide leave of absences in between (for good reasons, I swear) comes the third reincarnation of this portfolio. I shut down v2.0 with a construction sign in late May of 2014. But of course, my work is never quite done and I will keep changing and improving upon things I'm not quite satisfied with. But for now, I think it serves my purposes very well.

<div class="header">visual obituary</div>
A few final pixels of v2.0. As you can tell, my signature remains to be the digital representation of myself and my dance with minimalism is nothing new. What has since been improved upon, I hope, is the structure and intuitiveness of the website.

<div class="header">unfinished business</div>
A to-do list:<br>
- More comprehensive case studies of past work<br>
- <strike>Replace hover over effect on landing page in mobile devices with something more intuitive to the device</strike><br>
- The crossout effect for header links isn't quite centered on some computers and devices<br>
- <strike>The back button on the bottom of work pages need to be cleaner and more obvious</strike><br>
- About page is unattractive and unexpressive
