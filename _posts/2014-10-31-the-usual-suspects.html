My friend turned 21 two weeks back and while we threw him a worthy celebration, I wanted to give him a more memorable gift for such a milestone in his life. So in the effort to immortalize his favorite film of all time, I printed a 160-page book of the movie screenplay courtesy of the Cornell Store <a href="http://cornell.indiebound.com/cornell-store-presents-espresso-book-machine" alt="Cornell University Espresso" target="_blank">Espresso Book Machine</a>, accompanied by some important screenshots. Next to each is the frame's timestamp. Here are a selected few of my favorite spreads.
