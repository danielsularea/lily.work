Before we get started, let’s talk setup.

## &mdash; Equipment
* Arduino Uno R3 (Atmega328)
* Standard servo (TowerPro SG-5010)
* Half-size breadboard
* Male/male jumper wires (75mm and/or 150mm)
* USB cable — standard A-B
* Breadboard trim potentiometer — optional, good for developing purposes

## &mdash; Software
Install the appropriate IDE for your computer [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). It’s open-source and you will use it to upload code to the Uno board.

## &mdash; Additional Information
I am totally new to Arduino and hope that documenting my progress helps anyone else eager to learn. To that end, I will be working with only a basic set of parts and will not be offended if you want to refer to any of the fabulous tutorials below (in addition to mine, of course):
