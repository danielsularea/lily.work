<!-- IBM's Watson shook the world of artifical intelligence in 2011 when it defeated past champions of _Jeopardy_ in their own game. -->

My job requires me to interface with doctors regularly in order to understand them as users. But sometimes, I speak to them so that I might automate their work with artificial intelligence.

My admittedly brief but immersive experience says: yes, AI will take over jobs but it will not eliminate work.
