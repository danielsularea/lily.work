title:  Blade Runner in Print&mdash;And Better
---

As an accidental sequel to my [last]({{ site.url }}/blog/the-usual-suspects-screenplay-book.html) screenplay project, I recently finished and printed another screenplay book. This time for Blade Runner and with way better design decisions (ie print dimensions, typography, margins, the works). Here are my favorite shots:
