title:  The Usual Suspects in Print
---

My friend turned 21 two weeks back and while we threw him a worthy celebration, I wanted to give him a more memorable gift for such a milestone in his life. So in the effort to immortalize his favorite film of all time, I printed a 160-page book of the movie screenplay courtesy of the Cornell Store [Espresso Book Machine][espresso]{:target="_blank"}. Here are a selected few of my favorite spreads.
