title:  Blade Runner in Print
---

As an unintentional sequel to my [last screenplay project]({{ site.url }}/blog/the-usual-suspects-screenplay-book.html), I recently printed another screenplay book. This time for Blade Runner and with way better design decisions (ie print dimensions, typography, margins, the works). I also scoured the internet for some concept sketches to throw in there. Here are my favorite shots:
